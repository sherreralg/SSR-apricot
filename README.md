# Molecular Characterization of Genetic Diversity in Apricot Cultivars using SSR markers

## This is a repository for a analysis of SSR data in R.

### About me

Hi! My name is Sara Herrera. I'm currently a PhD student at the Centro de Investigación y Tecnología Agroalimentaria de Aragón (Zaragoza, Spain) mentored by Javier Rodrigo and Jorge Lora.

The script (a shortened version) and the dataset that I provide in this repository are part of my PhD and the results are published in the Special Issue "Genetic Diversity Evaluation of the Fruit Trees" of the open-access journal *Agronomy* (see below).

I hope this material is useful for you. If you want to find out more about our work, or have any question or doubt, please e-mail me: sherreral@aragon.es
